### Hero Section:

<div style="float: left">
<img src="/images/HeroSection.jpeg" style="width:50%;">
</div><div>
You can change the Title and Subtitle under the hero section of your homepage.<br>
Hero banner:<br>
You can upload images up to 5MB to be used as the Hero Banner (background). We would encourage schools to use static photos instead of gif as they will provide the best resolution. However, you prefer to create a animated banner, there are free online gif-maker like [this](https://ezgif.com/maker) which you can use.
