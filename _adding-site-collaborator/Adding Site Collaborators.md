#### Email Based Login Repo

	A: You cannot add your colleague(s) to your Isomer site if they have never logged onto the IsomerCMS.

  
Get them to do the following:&nbsp;

1.  Go to the IsomerCMS ([cms.isomer.gov.sg](http://cms.isomer.gov.sg/))
2.  Login via email (with their WOG/healthcare/whitelisted email)&nbsp;
3.  They should be able to log in but won't see any sites assigned to them.
* It's normal; this is because our system needs to capture their email address(es)
4.  Get them to update you, and you should be able to give them access right after</p></div></li>
