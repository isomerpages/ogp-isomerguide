### Embedding of Content

**Incorporating External Content into Your Website Using Content Embedding**

Content embedding enables you to seamlessly integrate content from external websites into your own website. On Isomer, only **Google Workspace** and **YouTube** are permitted for content embedding.

To incorporate embedded content, you need to generate an iframe code from the content that you wish to embed and then transfer it to the CMS editor.

There are guides for doing so available online, which you can find below:
