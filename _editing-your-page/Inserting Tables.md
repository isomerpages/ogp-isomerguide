## Markdown

Clicking on the table icon located within the toolbar will automatically bring up a Markdown table within your CMS.

  

> | Syntax      | Description |
> | ----------- | ----------- |
> | Header      | Title       |
> | Paragraph   | Text        |

Cell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.

| Syntax | Description |

| --- | ----------- |

| Header | Title |

| Paragraph | Text |

  
  

### Alignment

You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |

| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |

| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |

| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

  
  

Do note that our Markdown tables come in a standard format; 

*   there are dividers for rows
    
*   no dividers for columns even though they are clearly spaced

## HTML


## I am not familiar with Markdown or HTML, can I still add a table?

There are some workarounds if you are untrained in html. There are also some free-to-use html table generator available online such as [https://www.tablesgenerator.com/](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/). Your teachers could paste the table content into the generator, customise the font size, text alignment and table borders etc, generate code and paste them into the CMS editor.
