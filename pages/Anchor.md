Anchor is an element that allows a user to be directed to a particular section of a page. An anchor will be particularly useful if the page is long and you'll like to reduce the amount of scrolling the user have to do before arriving at a section.

**\[Word that will appear on site\](#word that website will look for):

E.g. \[Pookie\](#pookie)

  

Put at where you want it to be:

E.g. <a name="pookie"></a>

  

If header: 

\### <a name="pookie"></a>Pookie
