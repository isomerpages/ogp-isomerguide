<br>
	A: You cannot add your colleague(s) to your Isomer site if they have never logged onto the IsomerCMS.

  
Get them to do the following:
	</p><ol>
		<li>Go to the IsomerCMS ([cms.isomer.gov.sg](http://cms.isomer.gov.sg/))</li>
		<li>Login via email (with their WOG/healthcare/whitelisted email) </li>
		<li>They should be able to log in but won't see any sites assigned to them.</li>
		<i>It's normal; this is because our system needs to capture their email address(es)</i>
		<li>Get them to update you, and you should be able to give them access right after</li>
	</ol>
<p></p></div></li></ul>
